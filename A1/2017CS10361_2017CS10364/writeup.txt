We have implemented Local Search in the space of complete solutions of a fixed common length 'n'. We do the search by taking greedy steps with some probability, else taking random steps.
We first do quick searches by varying common lengths, and get good candidates for common lengths.
We then do deep and long searches for those picked candidates. We also randomly restart and search in the space.
We output the minces seen till now.
